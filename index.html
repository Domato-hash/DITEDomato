          <h3>BRIEF HISTORY OF SIBULAN</h3>
          <p>Noting the wealth of springs in this area, the Spaniards named it ‘Land of Sibuls’ which meant land of numerous springs. Influence of time, as well as elements of change, got the name of this municipality modified to Sibulan, its present name. In 1838, this town became a Parish under secular order. In 1856, the parish was occupied by a regular church priest. Then, in 1910, Sibulan had its initial set of municipal government officials once it became a municipality. This was in accordance to Act No. 82 of the Philippine Commission dated January 31, 1910. Macario Literal was the first appointed municipal mayor.</p>
